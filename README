SparqlScape
by kellrott@gmail.com

This plugin is designed to add SPARQL support to Cytoscape.
Compared to RDFScape ( http://www.bioinformatics.org/rdfscape/wiki/ )
SparqlScape is designed to connect to an external SPARQL endpoint for 
graph queries. SparqlScape is also designed to have no external 
dependicies, so you can add the plugin and make queuies without having
download Jena or any other RDF library.
